All these project mentioned above were modified from Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course book by Ronald Kiprono:
Matthes, E. (2022). Python crash course: A hands-on, project-based introduction to programming (3rd ed.). No Starch Press.

On the other hand, Kaggle runs a machine learning competition on the Titanic data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanicLinks to an external site.
This notebook is from Alexis Cook's Titanic Tutorial page: https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial

Lastly Chatbot.py program was made from scratch by me.
